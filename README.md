### Stonks!:tm:  -  Stocks with Django.
This is a temporary readme file. I just recently changed this project to its own repo (here).
I renamed the app and will take new screenshots. I will also translate it to english as soon as possible.
<h5>Introduction:</h5>
<p>This web app consists of five modules to control individual users on forums, custom stock price alerts, personal stock wallet and a live stock price tracker. It is written in Python using the Django framework with Celery and Redis for socket communication, yahoo-fin for price checking and Plotly for graphs.</p>
