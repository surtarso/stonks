```

The `stockpicker.html` page extends the base template `'mainapp/basic.html'`, ensuring consistent styling and layout throughout the application.

## Page Title

```html
{% block title %}
Stonks! - Picker
{% endblock title %}
```

The title of the `stockpicker.html` page is set to "Stonks! - Picker", which is displayed in the browser tab.

## Stock Picker Form

```html
<form class="form-control bg-light" action="/stocktracker">
```

The stock picker form initiates a request to the "/stocktracker" URL, where users can view the selected stocks' details and information.

## Stock Selection

```html
<select class="form-select form-select-lg mb-3" size="15" multiple aria-label="multiple select example" name="stockpicker">
    {% for i in stockpicker %}
    <option value="{{i}}">{{i}}</option>
    {% endfor %}
</select><br>
```

The dropdown menu allows users to select multiple stocks from the list of available tickers. The options are generated dynamically based on the stockpicker data. Users can choose which stocks they wish to track by selecting the respective options.

## Search Button

```html
<div class="d-grid gap-2">
    <input class="btn btn-primary" type="submit" value="Pesquisar">
</div>
```

The "Pesquisar" (Search) button enables users to submit their selected stock choices for tracking. When clicked, the button triggers the form submission, redirecting users to the "/stocktracker" page to view the selected stock information.

## Conclusion

The `stockpicker.html` page offers users a convenient way to select and track stocks within a chosen market. By extending the base template, it ensures consistent styling and layout. This documentation provides insights into how users can effectively use this page to select specific stocks for monitoring, enhancing their engagement and decision-making in stock tracking.

# Stock Graph Page Documentation

The `graph.html` page is where users can view historical price data for a specific stock in the form of a candlestick chart. This page provides an interactive visualization of the stock's price movement over time.

1. [Extending Base Template and Loading Static Files](#extending-base-template-and-loading-static-files)
2. [Page Title](#page-title)
3. [Graph Display](#graph-display)
4. [Error Handling](#error-handling)

## Extending Base Template and Loading Static Files

```html
{% extends 'mainapp/basic.html' %}
{% load static %}
```

The `graph.html` page extends the base template `'mainapp/basic.html'` and loads necessary static files for styling and scripting.

## Page Title

```html
{% block title %}
Stonks! - Graph
{% endblock title %}
```

The page title is set to "Stonks! - Graph", which appears in the browser tab.

## Graph Display

```html
<div class="container graph-container">
    <center><h2>{{ ticker }}</h2><center>
        
    {% if graph %}
        <div class="thegraph">
        {{ graph|safe }}
        </div>
    {% else %}

        <br><br>
        <p>An error has occurred.</p>

    {% endif %}

</div>
```

The graph container displays the title of the stock (`ticker`) and renders the candlestick chart using the `graph` variable. The graph is safely rendered using the `safe` filter to prevent any unintended HTML escaping.

## Error Handling

If there is an issue with rendering the graph data, an error message is displayed to the user.
